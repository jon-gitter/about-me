#### Reflections and Comments
  - Learned to utilize the ctrl with mouse click to change multiple lines of code at once
  - best to have a good wire frame **then** build your site, give more direction then wasting time going straight in
  - do each type of language first then move on to the next (ex: HTML, CSS, then JS).work in html first and build the framework, then make it look good with CSS, and make it run in JS.  I worked better not bouncing around to each but focusing on one at a time.
  - don't make things too over complicated, assignments are due, time is limited
  - keep taking good notes, they've been really helpful
  - practice good ACP, its only gonna make things easier later on
  - I did really well with understanding gitflow procedures, I taught someone how to do it and they learned well.


  
  
  
  
  
# Lab: 03 - Extend your 'About Me' and guessing game

## Project Name - About Me
  - I built a site that greets people and asks them a series of questions.  Also displays information about myself.  I have added additional games to have the user guess for correct information.  User is notified on correct or incorrect answers.

#### Reflections and Comments
  - Loops within loops were difficult to master for me today
  - Need to study loops
  - Need to better understand how to call on arrays and their use
  - I need to think more like a computer on processing information and getting it to display/run code like I want it to
  - I'm stronger in CSS and HTML then I thought
  - I learned that inside the {} of a for loop is where the loop will continue to get executed the number of times you tell it to run based on the () after the for

#### Reflections and Comments
  - fairly straightforward lab today.  I found it easy to add functions to both my repo as a navigator and Thomas' repo as a driver
  - I like how functions better organize my code into chunks to read easier and structure code better
  - both of us made the mistake of not ACPing fully before pulling changed branches to our main repo.  Also good practice to close out of VS code when you partner is working so you don't accidentally add updates to the main branch that conflict with your partner's changes
  - ACP often as both the driver and navigator
  - the driver and navigator challenge was fun, I like the teamwork used today
  - I have a strength working and communicating with others
  - explaining some of the loops code I created yesterday to Thomas has really helped me better understand loops, I feel confident now.
  - I still love learning javascript, this is one of the toughest things I've had to do mentally!
